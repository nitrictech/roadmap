✨ [view the roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/nitrictech/projects/4) ✨

The Nitric public roadmap provides a summarized view of the planned features for the [Nitric Framework](https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric) and surrounding projects. Me make a best effort attempt to release features in the planned quaters, however, the plan is subject to change as we learn more about how people use the framework and what they need to make it work best.

If you want to ask a question or provide input to this framework you can join or start a discussion in the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric/discussions) or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Webemece5C).

## How it works

All issues in this repository represent a Feature in the Nitric ecosystem. The issues are planned on the public roadmap board, which indicates the components of Nitric impacted by the change and the intended release timeline. These issues will often include links to issues in other projects that represent the development work required to build and release the feature.
